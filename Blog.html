                <h5>What Is A Natural Disaster?</h5>
                <p>A natural disaster is a major event caused by the natural processes of the Earth. It can be in the form of floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and other geologic processes. A natural disaster causes loss of life or property damage, and often leaves economic damage afterwards costing millions</p>

                <h5>Returning To Your Home After A Disaster</h5>
                <P>If you had to evacuate your home, you should only return after authorities tell you it’s safe to do so. Before you go inside, check for visible damage to your roof, floors and foundation. If you suspect any kind of structural damage, do not enter your house.<br>
                Once you’re sure it’s safe for you to enter your home, follow these safety tips:<br>
                 Wear appropriate clothing and shoes (long pants, long-sleeved shirt,
                rubber boots and gloves).<br>
                 Use a flashlight. Don’t use the light switches.<br>
                 Never try to turn utilities back on until your local utility provider has
                checked them.<br>
                 Don’t try to use any electrical appliances or power that may have
                come in contact with fire or water.<br>
                 Check for exposed wires and avoid contact with damaged or fallen
                power lines and power poles.<br>

                <h5>Can Natural Disasters Be Prevented? </h5>
                <p>We can't stop natural phenomena from happening. But we can make them less damaging if we understand better why they happen, and what we can do to prevent or mitigate them. Since people are partly responsible for disasters happening, we have to change what we are doing wrong, in order to avoid or reduce the impact of natural phenomena such as:<br> 

                The following steps we can take are:<br> 

                1.To stop the practices that are harmful to the environment and leading to environmental degradation such as:<br> 

                -The removal of trees during deforestation not only leads to global warming and destroys animal habitats, but it also disrupts the water cycle. Without trees to absorb rainwater, rainfall easily causes flooding.<br> 

                Irresponsible mining which can lead to devastating landslides and soil or mountain erosions.<br> 

                2.Raising awareness in our community <br>

                The ways we can raise awareness In making our community aware for the need for disaster prevention are:<br> 

                -Organising campaigns such as cleaning up local rivers in the community which will not only help to clean the surrounding place but also raise awareness on the dangers of pollution of water bodies.<br> 

                Encouraging people to protect nature through the help of advertisements, posters etc which can be used to spread information about human activities which can cause harm to the environment.<br></p>

            <div class="blog-cole">
                <h5>Disaster Relief (DR) Shelters</h5>
                <p>Adequate shelter has a significant impact on human survival in the initial stages of a disaster. A shelter requires more than just a roof
                for a space to be habitable. People living in a shelter must have enough clothing, blankets, mattresses, stoves, fuel, and access to services such as water and sanitation. DR shelters are commonly roofed, secure, hygienic, and habitable locations for people to utilize during periods of disaster until they are able to move back to their permanent dwellings. Many DR shelters are designed and planned so that they can be erected, dismantled, and stored for future use. These kinds of shelters are lightweight structures that can be used for several purposes. DR shelters include plastic sheets, tents, prefabricated
                housing, and public community buildings such as leisure centers, university halls of residence, places of worship, sports venues, and private rentals.</p>

                <h5>Food Aid</h5>
                <p>What is the purpose of food aid?<br>
                 Prevent malnutrition in the population affected by the disaster.<br>
                 It is necessary, however, to plan for the treatment and management of cases
                of malnutrition that existed prior to the disaster or which have become acute,
                and will become evident during aid operations.<br>
                What are the steps to follow in order to ensure an effective food aid program?<br>
                 Estimate the quantity of food available.<br>
                 Calculate the dietary needs of the affected population.<br>
                 Determine the food rations in accordance with the characteristics of the
                population and estimated duration of the effects of the disaster.<br>
                What are the priorities of a food aid program during disasters?<br>
                 Immediately provide food where need is urgent, or appears to be, as in
                isolated populations, institutions, hospitals, refugee camps, and among
                rescue teams and aid personnel.<br>
                 Make an initial estimate of the food needs of the affected population, taking
                into account its demographic characteristics.<br>
                 Identify food stocks, (food stockpiles elsewhere in the country, food
                assistance organizations, etc.), transportation, storage, and distribution.<br>
                 Ensure the safety and suitability of locally available food and supplies
                received.<br>
                 Monitor the food and nutrition situation closely, so that the supply and
                rationing of food can be modified in keeping with changing conditions.
                What is the proper management of food supplies?<br>
                 The objective is to ensure safety and prevent the transmission of disease
                through food.<br>
                 It is necessary to inspect the food received; identify and discard damaged
                supplies and confirm that containers or grain sacks are in good condition.
                Discard tins that are bulging, broken, or rusted, and reject products whose
                expiration date has passed.<br>
                 Verify that transportation units have not been used to transport hazardous or
                contaminating products.<br>
                 Make sure that warehouses have good ventilation and light, and that the food
                is placed on stands which allow air to circulate freely.<br>
                 Store food by its date of entry so that it can be distributed on a First In/First
                Out basis.<br></p>

                <h5>Feeding the Victims of Disaster</h5>
                <p>How do we ensure an appropriate diet, given the circumstances?<br>
                 As an immediate measure, provide any population group that is or appears to be at high nutritional risk with 3 or 4 kg of food per person per week. The important thing at this stage is to provide a sufficient quantity of energy, even if it is not a balanced diet.<br>
                 For a short period of time 1700 Kcal daily will prevent severe deterioration
                of the nutritional status, and famine.<br>
                How are food aid rations to be calculated?<br>
                 The food should be part of the food pattern of the population.<br>
                 The quantity of food in a ration should depend on the stage of the crisis and
                on available resources.<br>
                 For a period of weeks or even months, and while the victims depend
                exclusively or almost exclusively on food aid, rations should aim to provide
                1700 to 2000 Kcal per person/day.<br></p>
